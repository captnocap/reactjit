//! devtools.zig — No-op stub (inspector moved to tsz-tools)
//!
//! The embedded F12 inspector has been removed from app binaries.
//! Apps now only keep the thin debug_server hook + highlight overlay.
//! The full inspector lives in carts/tools/ as a standalone app that
//! connects over IPC (NDJSON/TCP) via the debug protocol.
//!
//! To inspect an app: run `tsz tools inspect` and attach to the target.
