# `useIFTTT` (V8 Runtime)

`useIFTTT` is the cart-side automation hook:

```ts
useIFTTT(trigger, action)
```

It connects one trigger to one action, tracks fire metadata for UI/debugging, and uses the shared `runtime/ffi.ts` listener registry as its bus. Most runtime events are plain bus events; Zig-origin system signals enter JS through `globalThis.__ifttt_*` handlers and are immediately re-emitted onto that same bus.

This is not the generated `framework/ifttt.zig` rule engine. That Zig module is a compile-time fast path for framework-side rules. The V8 cart API documented here lives in `runtime/hooks/useIFTTT.ts`.

## Public API

Import from either the hook file or the hooks barrel:

```ts
import {
  useIFTTT,
  busOn,
  busEmit,
  getSharedState,
  setSharedState,
  dispatchClaudeEvent,
  registerIfttSource,
  registerIfttAction,
} from '@reactjit/runtime/hooks';
```

Hook signature:

```ts
type IFTTTTrigger =
  | string
  | (() => boolean)
  | IFTTTComposable;

type IFTTTAction =
  | string
  | ((event?: any) => void);

type IFTTTResult = {
  fired: number;
  lastEvent: any;
  lastFiredAt: number;
  fire: (event?: any) => void;
};

function useIFTTT(trigger: IFTTTTrigger, action: IFTTTAction): IFTTTResult;
```

`fire(event?)` is an imperative escape hatch. It runs the same action path as a trigger fire and updates `fired`, `lastEvent`, and `lastFiredAt`.

Helpers:

```ts
function busOn(event: string, fn: (payload?: any) => void): () => void;
function busEmit(event: string, payload?: any): void;

function getSharedState(key: string): any;
function setSharedState(key: string, value: any): void;

function dispatchClaudeEvent(input: string | object): void;
```

Registry surface:

```ts
type IfttSubscription = {
  subscribe(onFire: (payload?: any) => void): () => void;
};

type IfttSource = {
  match(spec: string): IfttSubscription | null;
};

type IfttActionRunner = (rest: string, payload: any) => void;

function registerIfttSource(prefix: string, src: IfttSource): void;
function registerIfttAction(prefix: string, run: IfttActionRunner): void;
function setIfttFallback(src: IfttSource): void;
function resolveTrigger(spec: string): IfttSubscription | null;
function dispatchAction(action: string, payload: any): boolean;
function listIfttSources(): string[];
function listIfttActions(): string[];
```

Registry prefix matching is longest-prefix wins. Exact matches always work; prefix matches require a trailing `:` boundary, so `state:set:` beats `state:`.

## Built-In Triggers

String triggers:

| Trigger | Payload | Source |
|---|---|---|
| `mount` | `{ at }` | Fires synchronously when subscribed. |
| `key:<key>` | decoded key event | SDL keydown via `__ifttt_onKeyDown`. |
| `key:up:<key>` | decoded key event | SDL keyup via `__ifttt_onKeyUp`. |
| `key:ctrl+s`, `key:meta+a`, etc. | decoded key event | Key parser supports `ctrl/control`, `shift`, `alt/option`, `meta/cmd/command`. |
| `timer:every:<ms>` | `{ at, interval }` | JS `setInterval`. Minimum interval is clamped to `1`. |
| `timer:once:<ms>` | `{ at, delay }` | JS `setTimeout`. Delay is clamped to `0+`. |
| `state:<key>:<value>` | matched value | In-memory shared-state map. Values are coerced from string to `true`, `false`, `null`, number, or string. |
| `<event>` | event payload | Raw bus fallback. Pairs with `busEmit(event, payload)` or `send:<event>`. |
| `click` | intended click payload | Registered, but currently no V8 producer emits `__click`. Prefer explicit `Pressable` handlers or `busEmit` until that producer is wired. |

System triggers are raw bus events produced by Zig/V8 handlers:

| Trigger | Payload | Producer |
|---|---|---|
| `system:clipboard` | clipboard text | `framework/clipboard_watch.zig` polls SDL clipboard every 250ms, then JS reads `__clipboard_get()`. |
| `system:focus` | `{ at }` | SDL focus gained. |
| `system:blur` | `{ at }` | SDL focus lost. |
| `system:fileDropped` | path string | SDL drop file. Zig stashes path; JS pulls with `__sys_drop_path()`. |
| `system:cursor:move` | `{ x, y, dx, dy }` | `SDL_GetGlobalMouseState`, at about 60Hz max and only on movement. |
| `system:slowFrame` | `{ ms }` | Post-paint frame duration over 32ms. |
| `system:hang` | `{ count }` | 3 consecutive slow frames; recovery emits `{ count: 0 }`. |
| `system:ram` | `{ used, total, percent }` | `/proc/meminfo`, 1Hz, only on changed sample. |
| `system:vram` | `{ used, total, percent }` | `/sys/class/drm/cardN/device/mem_info_vram_*`, 1Hz, first card with stats. |
| `system:resize` | `{ w, h }` | Window pixel-size changes, tier-gated to sm/md/lg/xl breakpoint crossings. |
| `system:claude` | normalized hook entry | `dispatchClaudeEvent`. |
| `system:claude:<tool>` | normalized hook entry | Lowercased `entry.tool`. |
| `system:claude:<phase>` | normalized hook entry | Lowercased `entry.phase`. |

Function triggers:

```ts
useIFTTT(() => score > 100, 'send:victory');
```

Plain function triggers run after every render and fire on a false to true edge. Keep them pure and cheap. Function leaves inside composable triggers are different: the composer polls them every 50ms.

## Built-In Actions

| Action | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `state:set:<key>:<val>` | Coerces `<val>` and writes the shared-state map. |
| `state:toggle:<key>` | Writes `!getSharedState(key)`. |
| `send:<event>` | Emits the trigger payload to the named bus event. |
| `log:<message>` | `console.log('[ifttt]', message, payload ?? '')`. |
| `clipboard:<text>` | Writes text through `runtime/hooks/clipboard.ts` and `__clipboard_set`. |
| function action | Called with the trigger payload. |

String actions pass through substitution first:

```ts
useIFTTT('proc:idle:123:5000', 'proc:kill:$pid');
useIFTTT('system:fileDropped', 'log:dropped $payload');
useIFTTT('custom:event', 'log:path $payload.path');
```

Supported substitutions:

- `$payload` -> `JSON.stringify(payload)`
- `$payload.path.to.field` -> nested field string
- `$id` -> `payload.id ?? payload.pid ?? ''`
- `$pid` -> `payload.pid ?? payload.id ?? ''`

## Composable Triggers

Composable shapes live in `runtime/hooks/ifttt-compose.ts`.

```ts
type IFTTTComposable =
  | string
  | (() => boolean)
  | { on: IFTTTComposable | IFTTTComposable[]; when?: () => boolean }
  | { all: IFTTTComposable[] }
  | { any: IFTTTComposable[] }
  | { seq: IFTTTComposable[]; within: number }
  | {
      trigger: IFTTTComposable;
      debounce?: number;
      throttle?: number;
      once?: boolean;
      cooldown?: number;
    };
```

Examples:

```ts
useIFTTT(
  { on: 'key:ctrl+s', when: () => isDirty },
  'send:save',
);

useIFTTT(
  {
    trigger: {
      all: [
        `proc:ram:${pid}:>:800MB`,
        () => processState === 'running',
      ],
    },
    cooldown: 10_000,
  },
  'proc:kill:$pid',
);

useIFTTT(
  { seq: ['key:up:up', 'key:up:up', 'key:down', 'key:down'], within: 2000 },
  'send:cheat',
);
```

String leaves are edge events. They latch true for one microtask and then auto-clear, which lets `all` and `any` combine event edges with sustained function conditions. Function leaves are polled every 50ms.

Current sharp edge: `{ on, when }` calls `when()` without the trigger payload. Do not write `when: (event) => ...` unless `ifttt-compose.ts` is changed to pass the payload.

## Process Sources And Actions

`useIFTTT.ts` imports `runtime/hooks/process.ts` for side-effect registration. `runtime/package.json` marks that file as side-effectful so esbuild keeps the registrations.

Sources:

| Trigger | Payload | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| `proc:line:<pid>:<regex>` | `{ pid, line, match }` | Subscribes to `proc:stdout:<pid>` and applies a JS `RegExp`. |
| `proc:ram:<pid>` | proc stat payload | Auto-arms `__proc_watch_add`. |
| `proc:ram:<pid>:>:<threshold>` | proc stat payload | Threshold can be fraction (`0.8`), percent (`80%`), or bytes (`500MB`, `2GB`). |
| `proc:ram:<pid>:<:<threshold>` | proc stat payload | Same threshold parser. |
| `proc:cpu:<pid>` | cpu sample payload | Auto-arms watcher. |
| `proc:idle:<pid>:<ms>` | `{ pid, id, idleMs, at }` | Fires after no cpu/stdout/stderr activity for the window. |

Actions:

| Action | Behavior |
|---|---|
| `proc:spawn:<cmd>` | Spawns a process with no args. Result pid is dropped. |
| `proc:kill:<pid>` | Sends `SIGTERM`. Works well with `$pid`/`$id` substitution. |
| `proc:write:<pid>:<text>` | Writes text to stdin. |

Zig side: `framework/v8_bindings_process.zig` drains stdout/stderr/exit and proc sampling in `tickDrain()`, emitting channels through `__ffiEmit`.

Raw process channels also work through the fallback:

```ts
useIFTTT(`proc:stdout:${pid}`, (line) => {});
useIFTTT(`proc:stderr:${pid}`, (line) => {});
useIFTTT(`proc:exit:${pid}`, (result) => {});
```

## File Watch Sources

`useIFTTT.ts` also imports `runtime/hooks/useFileWatch.ts` for side-effect registration.

| Trigger | Payload |
|---|---|
| `fs:changed:<path>` | `FileWatchEvent` for modified entries. |
| `fs:created:<path>` | `FileWatchEvent` for created entries. |
| `fs:deleted:<path>` | `FileWatchEvent` for deleted entries. |
| `fs:any:<path>` | Any file-watch event. |

`FileWatchEvent`:

```ts
type FileWatchEvent = {
  watcherId: number;
  type: 'created' | 'modified' | 'deleted';
  path: string;
  size: number;
  mtimeNs: number;
};
```

The DSL always attaches recursive watchers. `framework/fswatch.zig` ticks every frame; JS drains queued events through `__fswatchDrain()` on a singleton 100ms timer.

## End-To-End Pipeline

1. A cart calls `useIFTTT(trigger, action)`.
2. The hook stores the latest action in a ref, creates a local `fire` function, and returns live metadata.
3. For a string trigger, `resolveTrigger(trigger)` selects the longest matching registry source. If none matches, the fallback subscribes to a raw bus channel of the same name.
4. For a composable trigger, `compileTrigger()` builds a tree of nodes and returns the same subscription shape as a registry source.
5. For a function trigger, React `useEffect` evaluates it after render and fires on false to true.
6. When a source fires, `fire(event)` increments the counter, records payload/time, executes the action, then forces a small state tick so the returned metadata updates.
7. String actions run through `substituteAction()` and `dispatchAction()`. Function actions receive the payload directly.

Bus mechanics:

```ts
busEmit('app:navigate', '/chat');
useIFTTT('app:navigate', (path) => nav.push(path));
```

`busEmit` is synchronous because it calls `ffi.emit()`. Zig-origin async domains usually call `globalThis.__ffiEmit(channel, payload)`, and `ffi.ts` defers listener dispatch with `setTimeout(0)` to avoid setState during host/event commit.

System signal path:

```text
SDL or per-frame poll
  -> framework/system_signals.zig or framework/clipboard_watch.zig
  -> v8_runtime.callGlobal("__beginJsEvent")
  -> v8_runtime.evalExpr("__ifttt_onSystemFoo(...)")
  -> runtime/hooks/useIFTTT.ts global handler
  -> ffi.emit("system:foo", payload)
  -> useIFTTT subscriber fire(payload)
  -> action
```

Key path:

```text
SDL_EVENT_KEY_DOWN / KEY_UP
  -> engine.zig packs (mod << 16) | (sym & 0xFFFF)
  -> __ifttt_onKeyDown(packed) / __ifttt_onKeyUp(packed)
  -> JS decodes SDL keycode + modifier mask
  -> emits __keydown / __keyup internal bus events
  -> key:* registry source filters by parsed key spec
```

Clipboard path:

```text
clipboard_watch.tick()
  -> SDL_GetClipboardText()
  -> Wyhash change detection
  -> __ifttt_onClipboardChange()
  -> JS clipboard.get()
  -> system:clipboard
```

File drop path:

```text
SDL_EVENT_DROP_FILE
  -> system_signals.notifyDrop(path)
  -> path copied into Zig stash
  -> __ifttt_onSystemDrop()
  -> JS pulls __sys_drop_path()
  -> system:fileDropped
```

Resize path:

```text
SDL_EVENT_WINDOW_PIXEL_SIZE_CHANGED
  -> system_signals.notifyResize(w, h)
  -> update latest w/h
  -> only fire JS if breakpoint tier changes
  -> system:resize
  -> installResizeBridge() updates runtime/theme viewport width
```

Claude hook path:

```text
Claude Code hook JSON
  -> .claude/hooks/ifttt-bus.sh
  -> normalize to one JSON line
  -> fan out by .claude/ifttt-transports.json
  -> HTTP POST http://127.0.0.1:7421/claude-bus
  -> cart useHost({ kind: 'http', port: 7421, onRequest })
  -> dispatchClaudeEvent(req.body)
  -> system:claude, system:claude:<tool>, system:claude:<phase>
```

The bundled isolated test cart implements that listener in `cart/app/isolated_tests/ifttt_test.tsx`.

## Runtime Initialization

`runtime/index.tsx` installs no-op `__ifttt_*` globals before React/runtime imports finish. That prevents telemetry/system-signals from spamming reference errors if a Zig tick fires before `useIFTTT.ts` has installed the real handlers.

Then `runtime/index.tsx` requires `./hooks/useIFTTT` for side effects. The real handlers are installed once using `globalThis.__ifttt_handlers_installed`.

Core host bindings used by the hook:

| Host function | Registered in | Used for |
|---|---|---|
| `__clipboard_get` | `framework/v8_bindings_core.zig` | Clipboard trigger payload. |
| `__clipboard_set` | `framework/v8_bindings_core.zig` | Clipboard action. |
| `__sys_drop_path` | `framework/v8_bindings_core.zig` | File drop payload pull. |
| `__viewport_width` / `__viewport_height` | `framework/v8_bindings_core.zig` | Resize bridge seed. |
| `__fswatchAdd` / `__fswatchRemove` / `__fswatchDrain` | `framework/v8_bindings_core.zig` | `fs:*` sources. |
| `__proc_*` | `framework/v8_bindings_process.zig` | `proc:*` sources/actions. |

## Current Users

Representative cart usage:

- `cart/app/index.tsx` subscribes to `app:navigate` and routes bus payloads through `nav.push`.
- `cart/app/InputStrip.tsx` emits `app:navigate`.
- `cart/app/composer/page.tsx` uses key triggers for editor shortcuts.
- `cart/app/EffectProfilerOverlay.tsx` toggles on `key:ctrl+shift+f`.
- `cart/testing_carts/watchdog.tsx` combines `proc:ram`, `proc:idle`, and `system:hang`.
- `cart/app/isolated_tests/ifttt_test.tsx` is the manual trigger/action test surface.

## Legacy And Adjacent Code

- `framework/ifttt.zig` is generated from `framework/ifttt.mod.tsz`. It stores up to 64 framework-side rules with typed trigger/action unions and executes them from `init`, `tick`, `onKeyDown`, and `onKeyUp`.
- `framework/qjs_runtime.zig` embeds an older QuickJS IFTTT implementation. QJS is maintenance-only.
- `framework/lua/ifttt.lua` and `framework/ifttt_lua.mod.tsz` are LuaJIT-era rule engines. The repo direction is V8 + Zig/TS, not new Lua IFTTT work.

## Review Notes

- `click` is documented in the hook header and registered as a source, but current V8 code does not emit `__click`. Treat it as unfinished.
- `{ on, when }` does not pass payload into `when`. Use external refs/state in the predicate, or update the composer before relying on payload-aware gating.
- `state:*` shared state is module-local in-memory state. It is not SQLite/localstore-backed and does not survive process restart.
- Plain function triggers depend on render cadence. If a condition can change without rendering, use a composable function leaf or a bus event instead.
- `system:vram` only covers Linux DRM files exposing `mem_info_vram_total` and `mem_info_vram_used`; NVIDIA proprietary setups silently skip.
- System resize events are breakpoint-tier gated, not per-pixel resize streams.
