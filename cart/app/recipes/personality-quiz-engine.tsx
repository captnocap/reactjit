// ── Author turn — produces a chat-loom intent tree ─────────────────────

const QUIZ_AUTHOR_INSTRUCTION = `You are the active assistant character speaking to the user. You are about to author a single short quiz aimed at one or two manifest dimensions where your read of the user is still thin. The cart will render your output as a real UI surface using the chat-loom tagset (see cart/testing_carts/chat-loom.tsx for the canonical reference).

This must read as a GIFT, not a survey. The user should feel that you are offering them entertainment / insight / a mirror — not collecting data. If it reads as data collection, you have failed.

Output format on this turn ONLY:

Wrap the ENTIRE response in [ ... ]. Inside, use ONLY these tags:

  <Col>                          vertical container
  <Row>                          horizontal container
  <Title>...</Title>             one short framing line
  <Text>...</Text>               (optional) one-line kicker
  <Form>                         wraps multi-question quizzes
    <Field name="qN" label="..." placeholder="..." />
    <Submit reply="A1: {q1}\\nA2: {q2}\\nA3: {q3}">Send</Submit>
  </Form>
  <Btn reply="reply template">label</Btn>
  <Badge tone=neutral>...</Badge>
  <Divider />
  <Spacer size=md />

Rules:
- Always wrap the entire output in [ ... ].
- Pick EXACTLY ONE metaphor family per quiz: gas-station snack, desert island item, obsolete file format, weather, vehicle, kitchen tool, season, soundtrack, room, pet, instrument, weapon. Stick to it.
- If the cart's prior-context shows this dimension was quizzed within the last 5 sessions, you MUST pick a different metaphor family.
- One quiz per turn. Either a single <Form> with up to 3 <Field>s, OR a single row of 3-5 <Btn>s. Not both.
- Every <Btn reply> and <Submit reply> must use a template that reproduces the user's choice in a normalized form ("I picked: {q1}", "A1: {q1}\\nA2: {q2}").
- Lead with a <Title> that lands the gift. NEVER label it as a survey or quiz-of-data.
- No tools. No HTML. No markdown. No prose outside the [...].

The cart will save your output as a QuizSession row, parse the intent tree via runtime/intent/parser.parseIntent, and render it via runtime/intent/render.RenderIntent. Your tree IS the quiz UI.`;

// ── Infer turn — produces ManifestDelta[] JSON ─────────────────────────

const QUIZ_INFER_INSTRUCTION = `You authored a quiz aimed at specific manifest dimensions. The user has answered. Your job is to infer ManifestDelta[] entries that update the manifest.

Output format on this turn ONLY: a JSON array, nothing else.

Each element matches this shape:

{
  "dimensionId": "<one of the targeted dimensions>",
  "previousValue": "<the manifest's current value, or null if never set>",
  "nextValue": "<your inferred value — must conform to the dimension's axis options>",
  "confidenceDelta": <number in [-0.25, +0.25]>,
  "reason": "<one sentence, specific to this answer>"
}

Rules:
- Emit one delta per targeted dimension. Skip dimensions where the answer says nothing useful.
- Reinforcement (same value as previous): confidenceDelta in [+0.10, +0.20]. The user has confirmed what was already inferred.
- Fresh inference (no previous value): confidenceDelta in [+0.15, +0.25]. Modest — manifest stabilizes through repetition.
- Contradiction (different value, previous confidence > 0.6): confidenceDelta = 0. The cart routes contradictions to a re-check quiz; never overwrite a confident value here.
- Reasons must be specific to the answer. "User picked plain peanuts → reads as no-frills / craft over flash" is correct. "User answered" is not.
- Do not invent dimensions outside the targeted set. Do not output prose. Do not wrap the JSON in code fences.`;

// ── Reframer enhancer — picks a fresh metaphor ─────────────────────────

const QUIZ_REFRAME_INSTRUCTION = `You are about to author a quiz aimed at a manifest dimension that has been quizzed before through a specific metaphor family. The cart has flagged the prior metaphor as stale.

Pick a new metaphor family from this set, EXCLUDING the prior one:

  gas-station snack, desert island item, obsolete file format, weather, vehicle, kitchen tool, season, soundtrack, room, pet, instrument, weapon, color, plant, beverage, wallpaper.

Output ONLY the chosen family name on a single line, lowercase, no punctuation. The author turn will read this and use it as the metaphor scaffold. Do not output any other content.`;
