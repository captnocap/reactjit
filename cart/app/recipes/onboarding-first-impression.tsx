// onboarding-first-impression
//
// Doc + stamp co-authored in one file. Turns the cart/app onboarding
// hand-off (name from step 1, traits from step 3, goal from step 5,
// model picked at step 2) into a 2-turn flow that produces a
// first_impression.md the cart loads as the user's welcome state.
//
// Shape: clarify-then-write. Turn 1, the model asks the user 3 short
// clarifying questions about their goal that the onboarding fields
// alone don't answer. Turn 2, with the answers in hand, it writes
// the profile.
//
// Why this shape, not one-shot or enhance-rewrite: a 4-variant probe
// (V1 raw / V2 enhance-once / V3 clarify-loop / V4 clarify+enhance,
// see the companion .md) ran the same fixed onboarding sample twice
// through `bench/claude_runner` (a Zig CLI around
// framework/claude_sdk). V3 was the only variant that reproducibly
// produced a meta-observation about HOW the user answered (the
// "answered sideways" insight). V1 was a solid baseline; V2 was
// high-variance and occasionally fabricated facts; V4 reliably
// laundered voice into a clinical report and was 1.5–2× the cost
// of V3.
//
// Why the recipe ALSO ships a concern-structurer enhancer: two
// follow-up probes (conflict-resolution with an external trigger,
// and profile-recovery with a wrong-on-disk profile + upset
// pushback) ran twice each through the same harness. The
// structured-concerns enhancer reproducibly produced the best
// downstream output in both — layered emotional reads in one,
// system-level meta-correction ("chat sessions don't carry over;
// the notes file does, and mine was wrong") in the other. The
// quantification enhancer reproducibly cooled the prose AND
// narrowed the scope of correction (only fixed what was explicitly
// contested). So when the cart-side gate detects an upset / conflict
// turn, it should run the concern-structurer composition first and
// prepend its output to the writing turn's user-message.

// ── The two-turn contract ─────────────────────────────────────────────────

const CLARIFY_INSTRUCTION = `You are about to write a first_impression.md profile of a new user, but first you need a little more signal than the bare onboarding gave you. Before writing anything, ask the user 3 short clarifying questions — questions you genuinely cannot answer from the onboarding fields alone.

The cart renders your response as a real UI surface using the chat-loom tagset (see cart/chat-loom.tsx for the canonical reference). Emit the three questions as a single Form so the user can answer them all at once.

Output format on this turn ONLY:

Wrap the ENTIRE response in [ ... ]. Inside, use ONLY these tags:
  <Col>                          vertical container
  <Title>...</Title>             one short framing line above the form
  <Text>...</Text>               (optional) one-line lead-in
  <Form>                         wraps the questions
    <Field name="q1" label="full question text in plain language" placeholder="short hint" />
    <Field name="q2" label="..." placeholder="..." />
    <Field name="q3" label="..." placeholder="..." />
    <Submit reply="A1: {q1}\\nA2: {q2}\\nA3: {q3}">Send</Submit>
  </Form>

Rules:
- Always wrap the entire output in [ ... ].
- Exactly 3 <Field>s named q1, q2, q3 — the next turn parses on those names.
- The <Submit reply> attribute MUST be the exact template above. Each {qN} interpolates that field's value back into the user-turn reply.
- Labels are the actual questions in plain language ("What does breaking even mean to you in year one?"), not field-name shorthand.
- Placeholders are short hints — a few words.
- No other tags. No HTML. No markdown. No tools. Do not write the profile yet.`;

const WRITE_AFTER_CLARIFY_INSTRUCTION = `You now have onboarding context AND the user's answers to your clarifying questions (delivered as the user-turn message in "A1: ... / A2: ... / A3: ..." form, interpolated from the chat-loom Form you emitted last turn). Write a markdown profile of this user using the Write tool, at the path the cart wired into your system prompt.

Cover:
- Who they seem to be (synthesizing onboarding + answers)
- Their goal restated charitably in your own words
- The 3 things you'd still want to learn next (NEW ones, not the ones you already asked)
- Where you would want to be careful — what assumptions might still be wrong
- An opening message you'd send them (2-3 sentences) when they first open the app

Use the Write tool exactly once. Be specific. Don't hedge. Sign the file '— Claude (first impression)'.`;

// ── Concern-structurer enhancer ───────────────────────────────────────────
//
// The cart fires a SEPARATE upstream Claude session with this as its
// system prompt whenever the user's incoming message reads as upset /
// conflict-shaped. The enhancer's output (a structured set of concerns
// with "what addressing it looks like" guidance for each) is prepended
// to the writing turn's user-message before it reaches the writing
// Claude. See the companion .md for the cross-test reproducibility
// data driving the choice of structurer over the alternative
// quantifier shape.

const STRUCTURE_INSTRUCTION = `You are a concern-structurer. The user will hand you a single message someone sent to a chat assistant. The message contains an emotional outburst alongside an actual ask, OR the user is pushing back on a mistake the assistant just made. Extract the concerns surfaced and structure them so the receiving model can address each one without conflating them.

Output format (no preamble, no closing summary):

Concern 1: <short label>
- What it is:
- Whether the assistant can act on it:
- What addressing it looks like in the next reply:

Concern 2: ...

(3-5 concerns total. Crisp. One bullet per sub-line.)`;
